# ShinyDashVax

10/20

This repository is a group collaboration for a course project for University of Michigan EPID 678, which will be an interactive Shiny dashboard for school vaccination rates throughout the state of Michigan.

It currently of three main files: dataScript.R, app.R, and PlotCodeChunks.Rmd

dataScript.R is for data processing and cleaning, using data from [MDHSS](https://www.michigan.gov/mdhhs/adult-child-serv/childrenfamilies/immunizations/data-statistics/schoolimmsdata)


app.R will be the final dashboard once complete, and currently consists of a shell for a potential website which needs a lot of beautification and improvement to actually do the desired operations

Finally, PlotCodeChunks.Rmd is more of a tinkering file, which contains code fragments to build final visualizations to be implemented in app.R.  These are intended to be written in as general of a form as possible (as  laid out in the chunk 2), so that they can take input from dashboard selections with minimal changes once they are finalized and we want to add them to the webpage.
